NEW IN VERSION 2

Version 2 of ouch represents a major revision.  
ouch's capabilities have been substantially extended.
In particular,

o   support is now provided for multivariate characters.  
    Inference based on multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and multivariate Brownian motion models is now provided.

o   nonultrametric trees are supported.

o   the root character state need no longer be estimated.  
    Instead, the root state is assumed to be distributed according to the stationary distribution of the OU process.

o   convenience functions for parametric bootstrap confidence intervals are provided.

o   the new function 'paint' simplifies the specification of adaptive regimes in complex phylogenies.

o   the new function 'ape2ouch' translates trees in the 'phylo' format of the ape package into 'ouchtree' format (thanks to Dan Ackerly).

The new package is a complete rewrite, using S4 classes.  
The old functionality from ouch v. 1 remains available, but is now deprecated.
