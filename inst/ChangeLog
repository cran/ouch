	* [r20] inst/ChangeLog:
	* [r19] DESCRIPTION, R/hansen.R: When the Choleski decomposition
	  fails (typically when the vcov matrix has a numerically zero
	  eigenvalue), formerly an error was generated. Under these
	  circumstances, the stationary distribution of the OU process does
	  not exist and the likelihood is therefore zero. This fix traps
	  the error and returns -Inf for the log-likelihood (actually +Inf
	  for the deviance in the return from ou.lik.fn). Optimizers that
	  are robust to Inf can therefore proceed.
